Task 1
Write your schemas below. Consider your MySQL database as part of the given music database.

Please see server/schema.sql

Explain briefly your choice of persistence store.
Core data for running of the website is stored in MySQL (db music)
Tables:
1. users: for Authentication
2. songs: Information about uploaded songs
-- This database only stores the key information for listens 
-- i.e. the Number of total listen slots and the number of slots available
-- the logging of listens will be done in MongoDB
3. country: ISO Country List (Foreign Key from Song Lists)
-- currently allows duplicate anthems, would put "unique" on column if required no duplicates

Logs for Listening History will be in MongoDB ('music' db, 'listens' collection)
This is generally immutable information and will be a large amount of data 
thus is better stored in MongoDB.
Decided not to duplicate data thus the Current Checkouts and the Currently Listening Users will pull from this table
listen format {
	user_name: string,
	song_title: string,
	country_code: string,
	checkedout: datetime,
	checkedin: datetime
}

All Images and Songs were stored as S3 files 

Task 7
Using the information capture by your application's data model and the database connections/pool declared in your application, show using JavaScript, the ranking of national anthems by their listening popularity across your service's user base. You should rank your the songs from the most popular to the least popular. The ranking information must include the following 
- song name
- number of the times it was listen
- the last time (date and time) the song was listen
